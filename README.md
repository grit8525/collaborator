# collaborator

Dear Friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to explore potential collaboration opportunities. 
I have skills and knowledge to make money
But I don't get pay as much as American or European because I am an Asian
So I need a collaborator, exactly an agency who can help me
In short word, I will use your accounts in upwork or linkedin so that I can get remote jobs as an American
If so, I will get pay a lot of money and we can share all profit
You don't need to do anything, just rent me your account
If a call is required, you could help me because I don't have a American face
You will create your own account with my requirements and rend me with your computer so that I can work on your computer
If your computer is not available, you could buy a computer for me
If so, I am so happy
I will share with you 30% of profit basically
If you get more remote jobs, you can earn more money
Make sense?
Ofc, All money will be saved into your bank account because I need to be fully an American
I don't need access to your bank account because it's your personal account
You should send me rest profit to me
I will just work as virtual assistant
I want to collaborate with you forever

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
